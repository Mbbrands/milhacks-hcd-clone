Unlike other gear sites for men, you won't find any fashion or tech reviews.

What makes HCDMAG.com unique is that we are building a community of readers that want to share their best advice and stories with our audience. Not only can you use our website to find the best gear and gadgets, but you can also recommend your favorite products.

As a new publication we are already breaking records with over 1 million readers worldwide.

Our primary office is in beautiful Seattle, WA. In addition, we have a U.S. based editorial and advertising staff working around the clock to deliver high-quality content to our readers daily.

If you would like to learn more or what to find out how to work with us, <a href="http://www.hcdmag.com/contact/">please use our contact form</a>.
