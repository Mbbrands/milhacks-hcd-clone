This was one of General Motors editions of the Hydramatic transmission series.

This transmission is known more commonly by the name <a href="https://www.hcdmag.com/turbo-400-transmission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TH400</a>, although it did receive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo-Hydramatic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another name change in the late 80s</a>, adopting the name 3L80.

This is a durable and very well-known transmission, as it was in production for many years and applied to a wide variety of vehicles, not only General Motors. The TH400 was initially placed in Buick and Cadillac cars and later added to Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Pontiac cars.

This transmission eventually made its way into many of the truck applications for General Motors. The transmission was not exclusive to General Motors, as many luxury brands such as <a href="http://www.jaguarusa.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaguar</a>, <a href="http://www.ferrari.com/en_en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferrari</a>, <a href="http://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolls-Royce</a> and many others made use of this transmission.

The TH400 was first introduced beginning in 1964, as it began to replace the Super Turbine 300 transmission, which was a 2 speed automatic. The Turbo 400 was placed in many cars across GM as well as other car manufacturers during its long production life.

Overall the transmission remained in production an impressive 27 years before it was eventually replaced by a 4 speed electronically controlled transmission, the <a href="http://www.hcdmag.com/4l80e-transmission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4L80E</a>, in 1991.
<h2>Common Problems</h2>
The TH400 was very popular, particularly known for its strength. One of the attributes that is credited with providing this strength is the cast iron center support.
