The transmission did change manufacturers to <a href="http://www.tremec.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tremec</a>, formerly Transmission Technology Corporation in 1998.

This transmission was designed for rear-wheel car applications. Being manufactured by Borg-Warner meant that this transmission was available in a number of cars across several different car manufacturers.

The initial development for the T56 transmission was for the <a href="http://www.dodge.com/en/viper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dodge Viper</a> application but it did not take long for this transmission to be installed in a variety of cars.

The next OEM to jump on board was General Motors in the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro. In the late 90s, early 2000s, <a href="http://www.astonmartin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aston Martin</a> added this transmission to a pair of its models, and Ford also offered the T56 in the Mustang Cobra.

The T56 transmission was first introduced in 1992 in the Dodge Viper, where it remained for 15 years until 2007, an impressive run, particularly in this class of automobile.

Eventually the T56 was phased out completely, soon after its deletion from the Viper. 2008 was the final year of normal production, primarily being used in Holden and FPV applications that year.
<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
This transmission had a number of features that contributed to its popularity and widespread use. Given that it was primarily used in performance cars, the primary characteristic was its strength and durability.

The T56 also offered double overdrive, with its top 2 gears both being overdrive gears. The transmission was also known for being very quiet.

The primary complaint from drivers of this transmission is grinding noise that can occur, although this is commonly due to hydraulic system not being maintained properly after clutch replacement.
<h2>T56 Performance Specs</h2>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1245" src="http://www.hcdmag.com/wp-content/uploads/dodge_viper_srt10-300x162.jpg" alt="Dodge Viper SRT10" width="300" height="162">As mentioned, the strength was one of the primary features of this transmission. Although the max torque varied by application, it was possible to get a model of this transmission rated at 550 lb-ft of torque, specifically Dodge Viper after 2003, but 450 lb-ft was a more common value.

The T56 is longitudinally mounted, and is a 6-speed manual transmission. The transmission is also rated to handle just over 3200 pounds GVW.

The gear ratios offered by this transmission do vary depending on the application in which it is used. The first option of gear set is 2.97 in 1st, 2.07 in 2nd, 1.43 in 3rd, 1 in 4th, 0.8 in 5th and 0.62 in 6th, along with a reverse gear ratio of 3.28.

The other option is 2.66 in 1st, 1.78 in 2nd, 1.3 in 3rd, 1 in 4th, 0.74 in 5th and 0.5 in 6th, accompanied by a reverse gear ratio of 2.9.
<h2>Materials, Size and Weight</h2>
This transmission was light for such a large transmission, with one of the key contributors being that the case and bell housing were constructed from aluminum.

The length of the transmission also varied depending on the application in which it was used. The length from the surface of the transmission to the output shaft ranged from 26.4 up to 29.4 inches.

The dry weight of this transmission came in around 115 pounds. The T56 has a transmission fluid capacity of 4 quarts.

The T56 transmission was originally engineered for the Dodge Viper in 1992, but it was soon implemented into several other car applications from various manufacturers.

This 6-speed manual transmission offered the strength required for high performance applications, while also being known for being very quiet. The overall duration of the T56 in production applications was 16 years, with the final application of this transmission ending in 2008.
