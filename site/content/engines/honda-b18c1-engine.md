The engine is part of the "B Series" of engines created by Honda.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_B_engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Honda B engine family</a> offered a variety of engines with displacements ranging from 1.6 to 2.0 liters, and was considered the performance family of engines at the time. Overall the B family was available from 1989 to 2001.

In the name <strong>B18C1</strong>, the <strong>B</strong> represents the engine family while the <strong>18</strong> indicates the displacement, so 1.8 liters. The <strong>C</strong> after the displacement denotation was also added to indicate that the engine was equipped with VTEC, Hondaâ€™s variable valve timing function. Other engines in this family that have <strong>A or B</strong> following the displacement do not have this option.

<h2>Availability</h2>
The B18C1 engine was available in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Integra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acura Integra</a>. This is another Honda engine that many tuners use to further improve the overall performance.

The B18C1 engine was first produced in 1994. This engine was only produced in the USDM Integra, and production lasted a total of 7 years, from 1994 until 2001. As mentioned earlier, this engine line is part of the performance line, as the B-family was in general the performance engine, and the C represented VTEC, another performance targeted feature.

Although this engine was small, it packed quite a bit of power in that small displacement, which is one of the primary reasons for the popularity of this engine.
<h2>B18C1 Performance Specs</h2>
As mentioned before, the B18C1 engine is a 1.8L engine, but to be more specific the exact displacement was 1.797 liters, which is 109.7 cubic inches.

The advertised power numbers from the factory are <strong>178 horsepower at 7600 RPM and 128 lb-ft at 6200 RPM</strong>. Nearly 178 horsepower from a 109.7 cubic inch engine, particularly without a turbo, is quite impressive, and provides a strong power to weight ratio. The redline for this engine is 8000 RPM, although there is a fuel cutoff at 8000 RPM.

This engine comes with a compression ratio of 10.1:1. As mentioned earlier, this engine also has VTC to allow more optimal opening for the valves.

Another feature of this engine is secondary runners which open at 5700 RPM. The bore of this engine is 3.2 inches, which goes with a stroke of 3.4 inches.
<h2>Head, Block and Valvetrain Specs</h2>
The Honda B18C1 engine uses an aluminum alloy cylinder head as well as an aluminum cylinder head. To compensate for the strength given up because of the aluminum block, steel cylinder liners are installed.

There are also quite a few aftermarket options claiming to have better cylinder liners with increased strength. The modified liners in some cases allow for the bore to be increased which is also another means for adding power.

The valvetrain of this engine is a dual overhead camshaft. This engine has 4 valves per cylinder, 2 intake and 2 exhaust, for a total of 16 valves on the engine. This is one of the features associated with B-series engine family and is also one of the reasons that this engine is more of a performance engine.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The Honda B18C1 is a 4 cylinder performance engine with dual overhead cam technology. This engine as it was delivered in the Acura Integra was able to reach <strong>178 horsepower</strong>, which is quite good for a naturally aspirated 1.8 liter engine.

Overall this engine was available from 1994 until 2001 in the Integra model, but there is no doubt that many of these engines have been re-worked for more performance and in some cases moved to different models. This is another solid engine that was engineered and produced by Honda.
