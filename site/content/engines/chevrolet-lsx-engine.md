The LSX block is based on the LS7 engine and was designed to accommodate a number of displacements.

This block was built for strength with the design being made to handle very large amounts of horsepower and boost. The block itself is capable of handling up to 2500 horsepower.

The LSX 376 specifically is offered in with two different versions that are separated by the internal components that can reliably handle different amounts of boost pressure. The engine is manufactured by General Motors as a crate engine. Since this is a crate engine only, this engine can be found in a wide variety of cars, but there are not a lot of them found in any single car.
<h2>Why is the LSX Engine So Popular?</h2>
The LSX block was first introduced in 2006. The LSX 376 has been available since around that timeframe, and can still be purchased from the Chevrolet performance crate engines website. On the website you can purchase the engine with capabilities of handling 8 bar or 15 bar of boost.

One of the things that make these engines so popular is that the engine comes naturally aspirated, but many accessory options can be selected directly from the website. This is a nice feature for the person who likes to build engines themselves. While there are recommendations to choose from, people are free to get their parts from anywhere they like.
<h2>LSX Performance Specs</h2>
As purchased from the <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/performance/crate-engines/lsx-376-b15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GM performance website</a>, both the 8 bar and 15 bar capable boost engines come with the same power ratings. The reason is as mentioned before that the engines are delivered naturally aspirated. The engines as delivered have a max horsepower of 450 at 5900 RPM and peak torque of 444 lb-ft at 4600 RPM.

As can be gathered from the engine name, the LSX 376 has a displacement of 376 cubic inches. This is achieved with a bore of 4.06 inches and a stroke of 3.62 inches.
<h2>Head and Block Construction</h2>
The base materials for the 8 bar and 15 bar engines are the same, but many of the components differ to provide more strength for the 15 bar engine. Both engines are constructed with a cast iron block and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_alloy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aluminum as-cast</a> heads.

The 8 bar engine has a nodular iron crankshaft, powdered metal connecting rods, and forged aluminum pistons.

In contrast, the 15 bar engine uses a forged steel crankshaft, forged powdered metal connecting rods, and forged aluminum pistons. As a result of these stronger materials, the 15 bar is able to reach around 1000 horsepower in the right combination.

The valvetrain for both of these engines is also identical with both using a hydraulic roller camshaft in the block with a pushrod design. There are a total of 16 valves on the engine, with 1 intake and 1 exhaust valve on each of the 8 cylinders.

The LSX 376 is a solid engine for the person who likes to work on engines themselves. This crate option allows it to be placed in a multitude of cars and gives the person working on it the freedom to build the engine up just how they want it.

The 15 bar boost engine in particular gives plenty of room to create power and make an engine that will make your neighbor jealous. The 15 bar boost engine does cost close to $10k, and that is before customization of the aspiration system. That being said, there are few engines that can provide close to 1000 hp, and may be worth the price if that is your passion.
