The engine family is comprised of 3 separate engines, the 2JZ-GE, 2JZ GTE, and 2JZ-FSE.

The GE is a more basic version of the 2JZ engine family while the 2JZ GTE is the high performance engine. These engines were manufactured by Toyota.

This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_JZ_engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">family of engines</a> was available in a wide variety of domestic models, although the car models that were exported that had this engine were much more limited.

For some of the domestic and Asia only available markets, this engine was built into the Toyota Altezza, Aristo, Crown, Mark II, Chaser, Cresta, Progres, Soarer, and Brevis, while the engine was available internationally in the Toyota Supra. The engine was also available in certain Lexus models, the IS300, LS300, and SC300.
<h2>A Street Racing Legend is Born</h2>
The Toyota 2JZ was first made available in 1991, remaining in production until 2002. This engine was likely introduced in response to the Nissan RB26DETT engine which was gaining popularity at the time.

The 2JZ engine was popular due to its performance, especially the 2JZ-GTE model. This engine is also popular since it can fit into a wide variety of cars. This specific model was twin turbocharged, providing more response at low speed as well as the boost needed for strong performance at high engine speeds.

This is one of those engines that people who love power and street racing will continue to modify and use for their street racing cars. The engine is light and still puts out ton of power proportionally.
<h2>2JZ Performance Specs</h2>
As mentioned, the different engine models have different performance characteristics. The GE version reaches 212 to 227 horsepower and up to 220 lb-ft of torque in the right application. The FSE engine is quite similar, maxing out at 217 horsepower and 216 lb-ft of torque.

<strong>The GTE is the performance engine and is capable of reaching 321 horsepower in its North America applications. The engine is also capable of putting out 333 lb-ft of torque.</strong>

These numbers are reached in the sequential turbocharger applications, but are certainly impressive for the 2.997 liter, 182.9 cubic inch engine. This displacement is reached with a bore of 3.39 inches and a stroke of 3.39 inches as well.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>2JZ-GE:</strong> 212-227 horsepower + 220 lb-ft of torque</li>
 	<li><strong>2JZ GTE:</strong> 321 horsepower + 333 lb-ft of torque</li>
 	<li><strong>2JZ-FSE:</strong> 217 horsepower + 216 lb-ft of torque</li>
</ul>
<h2>Head and Block Construction</h2>
These engines are all constructed using cast iron cylinder block. Both engines also have cylinder heads constructed of aluminum. The engines overall are quite similar in construction, although the GTE has recessed piston tops and redesigned ports and valves.

Much of this re-design was likely to accommodate the additional flow from the sequential turbocharge of the GTE engine. The 2JZ engine family uses duel overhead cam valvetrain, with 2 intake and 2 exhaust valves per cylinder, for a total of 24 valves.

The Toyota 2JZ family was a popular engine family, but by far the most popular engine was the performance based 2JZ GTE. This engine provided plenty of power, with a large amount of the difference coming from the induction system of the GTE.

This engine has factory numbers posted up to 321 horsepower, quite impressive for a 3 liter production engine, especially given the fact that this engine was developed in the early 90s.

A tuned up version of this engine can be found in many street race cars, as this is one of the more popular street race engines. The power to weight ratio of this engine make it a strong contender.
