This engine, along with the several other V8 and V10 engines, are a part of what is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Modular_engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ford Modular engine family</a>, which is essentially all of the V8 and V10 overhead cam engines.

The modular name may be misleading at first, as it sounds as though the parts may be interchangeable. However, in this case "modular" refers to the manufacturing plants being able to quickly change tooling in order to produce a different engine in that family.

The 5.4L Triton was originally available in Ford F-series trucks, Expedition, and the E-series of vans. Later, a 3 valve version was introduced as well to some Australian applications as well as being made available in F-series trucks, the Expedition, and the Lincoln Navigator.

The final revision was the 4 valve per cylinder setup, originally installed in the Lincoln Navigator but was later made to be primarily for performance car application like the Ford Shelby Mustang and the Ford GT.

This engine was first introduced for production in 1997 in the Ford F-series trucks. This engine lasted until 2010 in the F-series family but is still being used in the E-series van family.

While it is not an overly powerful engine, the 5.4L certainly has sufficient power for hauling normal loads and recreational equipment. The majority of people also seem to be happy with the reliability.

The weak link for this truck is the propensity for spark plugs to strip in the cylinder head during replacement; however it appears that this problem was addressed in 2007-2008 timeframe.
<h2>Ford 5.4 Performance Specs</h2>

With the introduction of this engine in 1997, the F-series version was producing 260 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque, using the 2 valve per cylinder configuration. By the time the F-series stopped using this engine, it was using a 3 valve design instead. This new design along with numerous other improvements had this engine reaching 320 hp and 390 lb-ft of torque in 2010.

<strong>The highest output version of this engine was in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Mustang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ford Shelby Mustang</a> that included a supercharger and was capable of 550 hp along with 510 lb-ft of torque.</strong>

The 5.4L engine measures 330 cubic inches for those who prefer these units. This engine comes with a bore of 3.55 inches and a stroke of 4.17 inches. The compression for the F-series version was 9.8:1.
<h2>Head and Block Construction</h2>
The primary construction of this engine is a cast iron block to be paired with aluminum cylinder head. Some versions of the performance engine version did include an aluminum block.

The connecting rods were fracture split powdered metal construction. The valvetrain for this engine did vary over time, although all engines used overhead cam technology. The original offering in 1997 was with a 2 valve design.

Beginning in 2004, the F-series changed to a 3 valve setup, followed 1 year later by the Expedition and Lincoln Navigator. This includes 2 intake and 1 exhaust valve per cylinder.

The 4 valve setup was also available with this engine, introduced in 1999 in the Lincoln Navigator and used in the Navigator for 5 years before it switched to the 3 valve setup. Other 4 valve applications were primarily used in sports cars.

The 5.4L Triton is an engine that has been around for a considerable amount of time. It was introduced in 1997 and used in F-series through 2010, and it is still available in the E-series vans.

Although this engine has some issues, as most engines do, they have mostly been resolved, and the overall consensus is that this is a highly reliable engine. In some applications this engine was paired with a Supercharger for some real power, 550 hp. This engine is strong enough to get the job done in most cases.
