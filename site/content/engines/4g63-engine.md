The Mitsubishi 4G63 and 4G63T engines are 2.0L inline 4-cylinder engines that have been produced since 1981 and are still in use today.

Also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Sirius_engine" target="_blank">Sirius family</a> of engines, the 4G63 is produced by Mitsubishi for use in a wide range of applications. For instance, this engine has been used in Mitsubishi, Plymouth, Dodge, Eagle and Hyundai vehicles. More specifically, this engine is famous in the U.S. market for its use in the Mitsubishi Eclipse and Lancer Evolution.
<h2>History</h2>
According to several sources, the U.S. version of the 4G63 was produced in Normal, Illinois by <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20151110/CCHISTORY/311119998/diamond-star-motors-begins-output" target="_blank">Diamond-Star Motors</a>, a joint-venture between Mitsubishi and Chrysler.

The 4G63 was first produced in 1981 and was used in the Mitsubishi Lancer until 2007. While U.S. production of the 4G63 has stopped, the engine is still being installed in new vehicles today. For instance, the Chinese automaker, Landwind, is using the engine in its <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/11/26/jaguar-land-rover-not-amused-by-chinese-land-wind-lookalike/" target="_blank">controversial Landwind X7</a>.

During its heyday from 1992 until 2006, the 4G63T was popular due to its use in the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution.

The Lancer Evo used the turbocharged version of the 4G63, allowing it to produce 287 horsepower and 289 lb·ft of torque from only a 2.0L engine.

In some cases the 4G63 engine was able to produce significantly more power with a few slight upgrades. For instance, the Lancer Evo VIII FQ400 featured a modified version of the 4G63T that produced 405 horsepower and was sold by Ralliart UK. At the time, it had the highest horsepower output per liter of any street legal vehicle.

What makes this engine so remarkable is that Mitsubishi was able to extract all of this power from just a 2.0L or 121 cubic inch engine. Inside the engine you could find an 85 mm bore and 88 mm stroke.

To be able to withstand such a massive amount of power, the 4G63 was built with an iron engine block and aluminum cylinder head.

There were multiple versions of this engine produced over the years including both single (SOHC) and dual overhead cam (DOHC) versions. However, all turbocharged 4G63 engines feature DOHC.

Later versions of the engine incorporated Mitsubishi's variable valve lifting technology called MIVEC. This is similar to the VTEC technology found in Honda engines.

From 1989 until 1991 the engine was designed with a 6-bolt design. That is, 6-bolts were used to connect the flywheel to the crankshaft. In 1992 the design was changed to incorporate a 7-bolt design along with lighter connecting rods.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Although the 4G63 and 4G63T engines were used in a laundry list of vehicles since 1981, it was most recognized for the power it produced in the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution.

Equipped with just a 2.0L 4 cylinder engine, the Lancer Evo was able to keep pace with Lamborghini Murciélago, Audi RS4 and Porsche 911 Carrera 4S during multiple track tests by <em>Top Gear</em> and <em>Evo Magazine</em>.

Whether you are looking to restore a Lancer Evo to its former glory or strategize a 4G63 swap, you would be hard pressed to find an engine that produced as much horsepower in such a small package.
