For anyone that needs a little extra traction with their lawn mower, Carlisle Super Lug tires just might do the trick. These tires are aggressive traction tires that are designed for a wide range of applications.

For example, they can be installed on lawn mowers, tillers, garden tractors, trenchers and even snow throwers.

<strong>Oh yeah, did I mention theyâ€™re great for ATVs, too?</strong>

The lug design provides the extra traction you need to climb hills, drive through sand and mud or improve steering. Without enough traction you could find yourself spinning your wheels in the middle of your yard with no help in sight.

Many of my readers have found that the Super Lug tires give them extra traction to drive over hills when the grass is wet or muddy.

One reason many people choose Carlisle tires is because of their great price and high-quality design. We found that Amazon had the best prices online, and they usually were able to ship the tires in only a few days.

You can see from the reviews above that Carlisle Super Lug tires deliver exactly what they promise - more traction. The best part is that you can get a great deal on these tires from Amazon. Why not upgrade your lawn mower with a new set of tires?
