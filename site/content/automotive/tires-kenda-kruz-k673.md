Not only will this tire handle a variety of conditions but it’s also H-rated. That means the tire can perform at speeds of up to 130 mph. <strong>Now that’s what I call speed.</strong>

If you like to take your cruiser motorcycle on long rides, you’ll be glad to know that this tire was specifically designed for today’s larger bikes. The tires is able to carry heavy loads when you need to fill your saddle bags on extended trips without having to worry about the additional stress on your tires.

As you can see Kenda over delivered again with this tire and will continue to do so in the future. This has proved to be a very durable tire at a great price. <em>Why put your trust in any other tire?</em>
