<h2>Reviews</h2>
The Carlisle Turf Saver has received excellent reviews from our readers. This tire is a best-seller because of the great price and the high quality construction.

The only concerns many buyers have is that they occasionally arrive misshaped or deformed. While the integrity of the tire is still intact, the shape makes them difficult to mount.

One easy way to fix this problem is to let the tires sit outside in the sun for a day to warm up and allow the rubber to relax.

A few readers were upset that the tire did not come with a wheel as shown in some pictures online. Please be aware that the price you see on most websites is for a tire only. However, this was not a problem for most customers because they were buying only one or two replacement tires for their lawn mower.

As you can see, Carlisle is the market leader for residential riding lawn mower tires worldwide because of their great prices and high-quality products. If you are looking for a replacement tire, you can’t go wrong with the Carlisle Turf Saver.
