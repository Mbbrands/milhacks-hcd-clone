What’s the best cruiser tire? That’s what I wanted to know before I stumbled upon the Shinko 777 motorcycle tire. You might be as surprised as I was to discover that the Shinko Group has been manufacturing tires and tubes since 1946! <strong>Today the company produces over 200,000 motorcycle tires per month.</strong>

Although the company is based in Japan, they have developed strong bonds with a company in Boise, Idaho to import their tires. This means you can rest assured that you will get great customer service and fast shipping at a great price. 

Whether you are looking for sportbike, cruiser, scooter or off road tires, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032HL2GE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0032HL2GE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=atveditor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shinko has one for you</a>.
<h2>Tire Construction</h2>
The 777 is a tubeless tire that boasts 4-ply construction. This means you can expect to get a long lasting tire that will give you great traction without breaking the bank. If you like to go fast like I do and want a great tire to help get the most out of your bike, then the Shinko 777 is for you.

The tire has an H speed rating, meaning it can safely handle speeds up to 130 miles per hour! However, it is unlikely that you will need to go that fast because these tires are built for cruiser style motorcycles.

A new set of tires will give you great traction and help your bike look good too. To help your cruiser stand out from the crowd these tires are available in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HMNG5C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005HMNG5C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=atveditor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">whitewall version</a>.
