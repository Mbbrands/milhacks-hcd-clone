One of the easiest ways to transform the look of your truck is with a suspension lift kit. Even a 2" inch lift can take your stock truck to the next level. However, there are a wide range of lift kits for trucks on the market. Which one is right for you and your ride? Below I've outlined the top selling lift kits online, so you can stop shopping and get back out on the road.

In the past, ordering a lift kit was complicated. There are a ton of parts you need to lift your truck and to make matters worse, not all lift kits came with the right parts. Today, Skyjacker leads the suspension market because when you order a kit from them everything you need comes in the box. Nothing is left out.

This Skyjacker kit is designed for Jeeps, but they have kits for almost all trucks and SUVs too. One reason why this kit outsells its competition is because it is extremely affordable but is also built with high-quality components. It currently has a rating of 4 out of 5 stars on Amazon. However, the only reason it hasn't received a higher rating is because a few customers had difficulty installing it on their Jeep. Keep this in mind if you plan to finish this project on your own.
