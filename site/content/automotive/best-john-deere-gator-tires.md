Want to use them on something else? No worries, these tires have a non-directional, open tread pattern that will allow you to go anywhere your heart desires.

One of the reasons these tires are so popular is because of their versatility.

Carlisle has had success with this tire because it was built for the working class. Anyone that needs a multi-purpose tire for the farm, field or work site won’t be disappointed by the Field Trax tires.

No matter what you throw at these tires, they can handle it. The thick sidewalls are designed to stand up to heavy abuse on the farm on in the field. You’ll notice that these tires also include a rim guard to protect your wheels from damage when driving through debris.

One thing I love about this tire is that it has superior puncture resistance that will help you drive with confidence.

Since these tires are from a well respected company like Carlisle, you know that you’ll be getting a long lasting tire. In fact, the tires weigh over 20 pounds each which backs up the fact that they are built to last.
