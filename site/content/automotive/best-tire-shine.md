<h2>Top Pick: Black Magic 5072647 Tire Wet Gel</h2>
<img src="http://www.hcdmag.com/wp-content/uploads/black_magic_tire_wet_gel-150x150.jpg" alt="black magic tire wet gel" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-5410">After testing dozens of tire shine products and being disappointed, <strong>Black Magic Tire Wet Gel</strong> (<a href="http://amzn.com/B000ENN9KG?tag=hcdmag-20" target="_blank" 0="0=" rel="" nofollow""="">check price</a>) was what we had been looking for all along.

You see, the mistake we made was falling for the gimmicks and marketing of tire sprays and foams. But that was our fatal flaw. Sprays and foams just don't have the shine or staying power that gels have.

To be honest we've been frustrated with how the shine from tire foam only lasted for a few days. Plus, we always had to keep the overspray off our wheels and the driveway, to prevent staining.

Well our prayers of wet look tires that last for weeks have been answered by Black Magic.

It is made from an advanced silicone formula that is weather and rinse-resistant. They claim that it lasts up to 8 weeks. So far this summer we were able to hold out for about 4 weeks before we decided to apply some more.

One thing we loved about gels is that they are thick and won't run down the tire. When you apply Black Magic to the tire, it goes on thick but it does require some effort to spread it evenly over the tire.

Be warned that you'll need to wait about about 15 minutes to let the gel set up. If you hit the road after applying tire shine it will sling onto your fenders - not something we recommend.

While we love the extreme wet tire look, we also want our tires to look somewhat natural. The gel allows you to apply it on at a thickness that suits your style. Apply it on thicker for wet, or a little less for a just a glossy look.

Overall, we've been extremely satisfied with Black Magic Tire Wet Gel and would bet you'll love it too.

<h2>2. Meguiar's Hot Shine High Gloss Tire Spray</h2>
<img src="http://www.hcdmag.com/wp-content/uploads/meguiars_hot_shine_high_gloss_tire_spray-150x150.jpg" alt="meguiars hot shine high gloss tire spray" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-5409">A review of the best tire shine products wouldn't be complete without a Meguiar's product on the list. Although we prefer tire gels over sprays, we voted <strong>Meguiar's Hot Shine</strong> (<a href="http://amzn.com/B01GW4ZE9O?tag=hcdmag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">check price</a>) as the best tire spray.

It will give your tires that high gloss wet look in just a few simple sprays. The tire spray is formulated from water-resistant polymers that will keep your tires looking good for a longer period of time.

That being said, the high gloss shine and staying power of a spray does not compare to the results you get with tire gels.

We recommend Meguiar's Hot Shine tire spray for anyone that wants a nice looking tire and a good value. Meguiar's advertises that just one bottle of their tire spray can treat up to 50 tires. That's enough to last you 6 months if you use it on one set of tires every 2 weeks.

Are you a fan of Meguiar's Hot Shine tires spray? If so leave us a comment and let us know why it's your top pick for the best tire shine.

<h2>Meguiar's G7516 Endurance Tire Gel</h2>
<img src="http://www.hcdmag.com/wp-content/uploads/meguiars_endurance_tire_gel-150x150.jpg" alt="meguiars endurance tire gel" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-5470">The runner up in our search for the best tire shine was another tire gel. We found that <strong>Meguiar's Endurance Tire Gel</strong> (<a href="http://amzn.com/B0009IQXJ0?tag=hcdmag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">check price</a>) out-performed other name brand tire sprays and foams in terms of shine and durability.

Meguiar's Endurance Tire Gel contains polymers that will help your tires hold that high-gloss shine for several weeks.

Like other gels we tested, this product does require some work to apply it evenly, but the results are worth the effort. Unlike tire sprays you don't have to worry about overspray on your wheels, brake rotors or fenders.

Don't forget to order an applicator or sponge when you buy a bottle of Endurance Tire Gel. Unlike <em>Black Magic Tire Wet Gel</em>, this product does not come with an applicator.
